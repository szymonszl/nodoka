# nodoka - todo list thingy

nodoka is a piece of software i wrote for myself, it's little more than a custom
todo list manager, and its main reason for existence is that it's mine

its main gimmick? no javascript here, all html and css3 abuse. seriously,
i'm proud of some of these hacks, and god bless whoever invented the checkbox hack.

if you have any luck in life, you probably dont want to use this. i've kept this
hidden from public view as a private project, but decided that i might as well
publish it

if you actually want to use this, then you're going to have to prepare a file
called `auth.py` and put it in the root and bring your own auth shit. i'm using
my own SSO called [Meirin](//mrn.szy.lol) for that, but i'm not planning to
release that anytime soon/ever

includes [silk icons by famfamfam](http://famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/)
licensed as CC2.5-BY, with custom 'filter' icon added (based on drink_empty).
i dont't think i deserve the copyrights to it, but if any lawyer has to ask,
then it's released under the same licence.

includes some cute images i've found on the internet :3
